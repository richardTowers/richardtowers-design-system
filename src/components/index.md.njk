Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different [patterns](../patterns) and contexts. For example, the [text input](../components/text-input) component can be used to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someoneâ€™s name.

If you have [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/richardtowers/richardtowers-frontend) included in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design&nbsp;System.
